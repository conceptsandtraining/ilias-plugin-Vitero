1 - Booking id issue in getSessionAndUserRecordingsByTimeSlot

Method getSessionAndUserRecordingsByTimeSlot from vitero returns bookingid value.
This bookingid id, is in fact, a booking time id. They did not change the "bookingid" name to keep back compatibility.

To obtain a booking object from  this booking time id we use the method getBookingByBookingTimeId($bookingTimeId);

3- Percentage round issue

After doing the maths with the attendance percentage we can obtain decimal values like for example 74.6666%
The current values are stored discriminating the decimals. For this example the stored value is 74%
